Overview
========

Synchronize your Delicious bookmarks against your Google Bookmarks.  By
default, this script will read the credentials file for your logins, fetch all
Google bookmarks, determine if anything changed since the last successful sync,
and perform the necessary adds/removes/updates to Delicious. The program only
touches Delicious if there are pending changes, otherwise relying solely on its
cache of Delicious (stored in `~/.gbookmark2delicious.cache`).

What about Lists in Google Bookmarks?
-------------------------------------

Not too long ago, Google Bookmarks introduced [Lists], which got me excited
because I thought they were a way to publish bookmark feeds, which would allow
me to retire gbookmark2delicious. It turned out to be pretty different---Lists
generate a feed for any updates to the pages in the List. (Plus, adding new
bookmarks requires that it be explicitly added to the List, and the bookmarklet
for doing so is IMO less usable than the regular Google Bookmarks bookmarklet.)

Usage
=====

First, create a `~/.gbookmark2delicious.auth` with four lines:

  your.google.username@gmail.com
  your.google.password
  your_delicious_username
  your_delicious_password

Now you're ready to run gbookmark2delicious!

  $ gbookmark2delicious

You may want to have this run regularly from a cron job.  I have the following
entry in my crontab to make gbookmark2delicious run every hour, a quarter past
the hour:
